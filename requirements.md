About the Project
This project is part of the comprehensive ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding. By working through these tasks, learners will design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality. The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing high standards of design, development, and data handling.

Learning Objectives
As a professional developer, completing these tasks will empower you to:

Apply advanced principles of database design to model complex systems.
Master the art of normalization to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
Use SQL DDL to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing for performance optimization.
Write and execute SQL DML scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data, simulating real-world scenarios.
Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.
Requirements
To successfully complete these tasks, you must:

Have a strong foundation in relational databases and SQL.
Be proficient in using Draw.io or similar tools for visual modeling.
Possess a good understanding of data normalization principles, particularly up to 3NF.
Have experience with GitHub repositories for documentation and project submission.
Follow industry best practices for database design and scripting.
Key Highlights
Task 1: Craft a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database design, ensuring clear relationships and properly defined entities.
Task 2: Apply normalization principles to refine your database design, optimizing data integrity and minimizing redundancy.
Task 3: Create SQL scripts to define the database schema, incorporating primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for optimal query performance.
Task 4: Populate the database with real-world sample data, simulating an Airbnb-like environment with users, properties, bookings, and payments.
Each task builds on the previous one, providing a step-by-step approach to developing a robust database system. By completing this project, you‚Äôll gain hands-on experience with real-world database challenges, preparing you for complex projects in professional environments.
